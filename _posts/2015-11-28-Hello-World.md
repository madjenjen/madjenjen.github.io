Right now I'm working on getting this blog up and running so we can post about some projects that turned out pretty dece!

I'm using <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/" target="\_blank">these instructions</a> to do it using Jekyll and the freely provided GitHub Pages hosting. The instructions are very clear and simple. There are a lot of **hard** ways to do this (as I learned several months ago...and then gave up), but these instructions make it super simple--until, of course, you run into problems. But that's the fun (read: desperately infuriating) part!
