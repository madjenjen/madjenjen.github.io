title: How to Start Automating Your Home (and Building a Blog)
---
Ok! Now that we've got the blog up and running, I need to figure out how one actually blogs: what's important, what's not important, what works, and what doesn't work. [This post](http://www.theminimalists.com/blog) on the Minimalist blog was very useful to get us off the ground. I will add my thoughts on our niche, value, and ideal readers to the [About](madjenjen.github.io/about) page soon. 

And now, on to official business! On this blog, I hope to share with you our adventures in \*attempted\* home automation. I am a mechanical engineer by training, IT manager by profession--I've got technical leanings, but I would not claim to be "technical" by any stretch of the imagination. Therefore, my vision for this blog is to share simple, easy-to-follow steps for others who are side-project-curious, and tinker-keen.

Our first foray into home automation began with Alexa--the AI (artificial intelligence) on the [Amazon Echo](http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-SK705DI-Echo/dp/B00X4WHP5E).
