title: Automatic Blind Openers
---
Our first custom project was to automate the opening and closing of our living room blinds. Yes, it's not that hard to get up and rotate the little rod on each window for 8 seconds, but it's waaaaay cooler to just tell Alexa to do it for you (check out <a href="http://pretty-dece.com/Start-Automating/" target="\_blank">a previous post</a> for an introduction to Alexa).

The idea for the project came from a visiting friend, so as a first step, we looked online for who's done it before. Lo and behold, it's definitely been done before (like most things). The starting point for our project was the <a href="http://makezine.com/projects/mini-blind-minder/" target="\_blank">Mini Blind Minder</a>.

Unlike the Mini Blind Minder, we wanted to interact with our blind openers via voice command through the Amazon Echo, so our design is somewhat modified. In this post, I'll discuss the hardware/Arduino portion of the project, and we'll have a celebrity guest post from TheConnMan next time to discuss the interface with Alexa.

To start, here's the list of parts we used aside from what's already in our <a href="http://pretty-dece.com/Build-Your-Toolbox/" target=""\_blank">toolbox</a>:
