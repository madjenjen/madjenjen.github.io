It's been about 2 months into this New Year's resolution and I've picked up some pretty dece tools and techniques for building a blog. In this post, we'll break away from convention and blog about blogging (Yo dawg, I heard you liked blogging...). Here I'll list and discuss some of the tools and techniques that have come in most handy along the way so far.

In <a href="http://pretty-dece.com/Hello-World" target="\_blank">our very first post</a>, we mentioned <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/" target="\_blank">this post in Smashing Magazine</a> as the most fool-proof way to get a blog off the ground. I maintain that it was the perfect jumping off point and recommend any new blogger who wants to dabble in custom code start with these instructions. And it's all free!

Once you've got that ready, here are some of my favorite blogging toolbox items:

			ColorHexa dubs itself the color encyclopedia. I use it frequently to convert RGB values to hex values for use in my CSS files to style the blog. It also helps you find complimentary colors to build a nice palette.
