Welp, our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-WiFi-Alexa/dp/B00X4WHP5E" target="\_blank">Amazon Echo</a> broke, and now we can't close the blinds. Of course we could just close them with our hands, the way people do, but let's be honest--that's preposterous. Once you automate, you never go back to hand-operate!

Luckily, there's a pretty easy solution while we wait for the development kit for <a href="https://madeby.google.com/home/" target="\_blank">Google Home</a> to come out in December.

If you haven't yet forayed into the world of <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes" target="\_blank">If This Then That (IFTTT)</a>, this is the perfect opportunity. I will ashamedly admit that this is my first time using the service!

### Toolbox Additions
We are only adding one item to our toolbox for this one.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="3">Inventory</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<a href="https://ifttt.com/products/do/button" target="\_blank">IFTTT DO Button</a>
		</td>

		<td>
			<center><a href="https://ifttt.com/products/do/button" target="\_blank"><img src="/images/Logos/do-button.png"></img></a></center>
		</td>

		<td>
			This is a very simple button created by IFTTT. It's literally just a button that you can program to do anything you want. In this case, we'll create two buttons--one to close the blinds, one to open them.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

And off we go.

### Download the Do app

You can download either the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/do-button-by-ifttt/id905998610?mt=8" target="\_blank">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ifttt.dobutton&hl=en" target="\_blank">Android</a> app on your mobile device. I have an iPhone, as you'll see in the screenshots below.
