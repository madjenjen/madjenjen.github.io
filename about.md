Hi! We're JMad and TheConnMan--we're just two home-automation-enthusiast-wannabes/DIY-try-hards trying to make things work pretty decently. Neither one of us has degrees in Computer Science or Electrical Engineering, so we Google a lot and will try to share all of our findings with you as we go along. Our projects are never super perf, but they're pretty dece. We hope you enjoy reading about them and maybe trying them out for yourself!
